WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

> I have added a few comments in the code to provide the basic functions atleast.

> The math part of the problem statement, I worked it out after thoroughly studying the reading material first and then was able to convert it into code using the links provided in the problem statement document.

> I have also referred to the Krittika python tutorials on GitHub for NumPy and MathPlotLib.

> I have looked up the algorithm and ideas for implementing the epsilon-greedy algorithm online. 

> The algorithm I chose to use was simple mostly based on if-else conditions. I used a random number generator to gemerate a number between 0 and 1 and compared them with epsilon to differentiate between cases of exploitation and exploration.

> I have also referred to Sutton and Barto for theory on the multi-arm bandit problem.

THIS WAS A FUN ASSIGNMENT AND GAVE ME A REAL TASTE OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
